This package counts the amount of records on a relationship and compares them with a given set of limits. This can be useful to determine if a user has reached the limit of files he can upload or something similar.

## Installation

Require this package, with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), in the root directory of your project.

``` bash
$ composer require faustbrian/laravel-doorkeeper
```

``` php
<?php

use BrianFaust\Doorkeeper\Traits\Doorkeeper;

class User extends Model implements DoorkeeperContract
{
    use Doorkeeper;


    public $limits = [
        'posts' => 5,
        'files' => 10,
    ];

    public function posts() {
        return $this->hasMany('App\Post');
    }

    public function files() {
        return $this->hasMany('App\File');
    }
}
```

#### Middleware
``` php
<?php
namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;

class ReachedLimits
{

    public function handle($request, Closure $next)
    {
        $user = Auth::check();

        if ( $user->limits($user->subscription->limits)->fails() ) {
            return redirect()->route('billing');
        }

        return $next($request);
    }
}
```
